# IR-Sarcasm-Detection-

## Accuracy: 76.92%
This Project was made on Jupyter Notebook and Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset.json data set is used. See Report for more details 

There are two files namely IR-Sarcasm Detection(Test).ipynb and Sarcasm Detection.ipynb

1- IR-Sarcasm Detection(Test).ipynb: This is a test file in which we took only 1000 example from Data set and tried different technique. 
                                     code in this file is divided into segments and output can be visualized after every step. Open 
                                     this file for better understanding of code. Avg Execution time: 5 min

2- Sarcasm Detection.ipynb: This is final file in  which the code is in modular form and only the final output of the model is displayed.
                            Avg Execution time: 3 hr
